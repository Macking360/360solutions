# GitHub Pages Setup

Follow these steps in the GitHub web UI:

1. Open repository Settings.
2. Open Pages.
3. Under Build and deployment, set Source to Deploy from a branch.
4. Select branch main and folder /(root), then Save.

Expected site URL format:
https://macking360.github.io/360solutions/

You can add a custom domain later in the same Pages settings.
